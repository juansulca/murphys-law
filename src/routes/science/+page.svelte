		<p class="mb-4">
			Murphy’s Law, has fascinated scientists and laypeople alike. While often dismissed as folklore
			or selective memory, scientific investigation reveals that many "Murphy moments" have
			tangible, mathematical, and physical explanations.

		<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 font-marker">Probability and Selective Memory</h2>
		<p class="mb-4">
			Humans tend to recall negative outcomes more vividly, giving the impression that bad events
			occur more frequently than they statistically do. However, probability often plays an
			unsuspected role in these experiences.

		<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 font-marker">The Physics of Everyday Annoyances</h2>
		<p class="mb-4">
			<b class="font-bold">Buttered Toast Phenomenon:</b> Toast often lands butter-side down because
			of the mechanics of rotation as it falls. Gravity and friction interact in such a way that the
			toast doesn’t complete a full rotation from typical table heights.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-4">
			<b class="font-bold">Why Tables Are This Height:</b> Table heights are optimized for human ergonomics,
			which, in turn, are constrained by our biology and even fundamental constants of nature.

			Other Everyday Examples Explained by Science
		</h2>
		<p class="mb-4">
			<b class="font-bold">Queues Moving Faster (But Not Yours):</b> In a supermarket, there’s only a
			one-in-three chance your chosen queue will move faster than those on either side, a simple consequence
			of probability theory.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-4">
			<b class="font-bold">Rain Forecast and Umbrellas:</b> Even with high accuracy in weather predictions,
			the infrequency of rain skews probabilities, making it feel as though carrying an umbrella "prevents"
			rain.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-4">
			<b class="font-bold">And the other?</b> sometimes, it's just bad luck.

		<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 font-marker">Broader Implications</h2>
		<p class="mb-4">
			From tumbling toast to missing socks, Murphy’s Law highlights how physics, probability, and
			human perception combine to create seemingly universal annoyances. These insights remind us
			that even trivial-seeming phenomena can stem from profound underlying principles, making them
			fertile ground for scientific inquiry.

		<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 font-marker">Takeaway</h2>
		<p class="mb-4">
			Murphy’s Law is more than a humorous observation—it’s a lens through which to explore the
			interactions of randomness, natural laws, and human perception. Understanding its science
			invites us to see order in chaos and motivates deeper appreciation for the principles
			governing our universe.
