		<p class="mb-4">
			Murphy's Law is a popular adage that captures the inevitability of failure or complications.
			It humorously suggests that if something has the potential to go wrong, it most likely
			will—and often at the worst possible moment.

		<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 font-marker">Origins of Murphy's Law</h2>
		<p class="mb-4">
			Despite ongoing debate about its origin, most sources—including Wikipedia—agree that Murphy's
			Law dates back to 1949 at Edwards Air Force Base in California. The phrase is attributed to
			Captain Edward A. Murphy, an engineer working on experiments related to the effects of rapid
			deceleration on pilots.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-4">
			When a technician improperly installed sensors, Murphy reportedly quipped, "If there’s any way
			to do it wrong, he will." This sentiment was later summarized as Murphy's Law by others
			involved in the project.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-4">
			In <i class="italic">A History of Murphy's Law</i> by Nick T. Spark, Captain Murphy is documented
			as being present during the experiment and is credited with saying, “If there’s any way they can
			do it wrong, they will.” This phrase was later adapted into the now-iconic, “If anything can go
			wrong, it will.”
		</p>
		<p class="mb-4">
			But how did this idea reach beyond Edwards Air Force Base? Colonel John Paul Stapp, who was
			also present during the instance when Murphy made his now-famous observation, played a key
			role. At a later press conference, Stapp was questioned by a reporter about their approach to
			risk management. Known for his showmanship, Stapp replied, “We do all of our work in
			consideration of Murphy’s Law.” When asked for clarification, he offered one of the most
			elegant definitions of the law:
		</p>
		<q class="ml-6 mb-4 italic">
			The idea that you had to think through all possibilities before doing a test so as to avoid
			disaster.
		</q>
		<p class="my-4">
			At its core, Murphy’s Law is an invitation to consider “what ifs” and to recognize potential
			risks and causes of failure. In theory, if it were possible to predict all the things that
			could go wrong, you could figure out ways to prevent catastrophe.

		<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 font-marker">Cultural Impact</h2>
		<p class="mb-4">
			Over time, Murphy's Law became a cornerstone of pop culture, appearing in various fields such
			as engineering, software development, and everyday life. It serves as a reminder to plan for
			the worst while hoping for the best.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-4">
			Variations and corollaries, like *Finagle's Law* ("Anything that can go wrong, will—at the
			worst possible moment"), expand on Murphy's ideas humorously.
